## Fall 2017

**Computer Networks**: graduate-level introduction to computer networking.
*Grade received: A*

From the OMSCS website:

> This project-based course will explore research topics in computer networking, primarily at the IP layer and above. Students will gain exposure to burgeoning areas of computer networking and learn how to use the tools commonly used for networking research, today.  

>This course is divided into 3 parts, which will be taken in order:

>Part 1: End-to-End, Naming, Routing & Forwarding

>Part 2: Resource Control & Content Distribution

>Part 3: Operations & Management, Software-Defined Networking

## Spring 2018

**Knowledge-Based AI: Cognitive Systems**: project-based course in knowledge-based Artificial intelligence. Semester project, an AI agent for solving geometric analogy intelligence test, included.

*Grade received: A*

From the OMSCS website:

>The twin goals of knowledge-based artificial intelligence (AI) are to build AI agents capable of human-level intelligence and gain insights into human cognition.  

>The learning goals of the Knowledge-Based AI course are to develop an understanding of (1) the basic architectures, representations and techniques for building knowledge-based AI agents, and (2) issues and methods of knowledge-based AI. The main learning strategies are learning-by-example and learning-by-doing. Thus, the course puts a strong emphasis on homework assignments and programming projects. The course will cover three kinds of topics: (1) core topics such as knowledge representation, planning, constraint satisfaction, case-based reasoning, knowledge revision, incremental concept learning, and explanation-based learning, (2) common tasks such as classification, diagnosis, and design, and (3) advanced topics such as analogical reasoning, visual reasoning, and meta-reasoning.

## Summer 2018

**Software Development Process**: Graduate-level, project-based in the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. Semester project required designing, documenting, building, and testing an Android app for creating and solving cryptograms. Served as project manager, lead designer, and lead programmer on the four-person team.

*Grade received: A*

From the OMSCS website:

>This course provides an in-depth study of the process of developing software systems, including the use of software processes in actual product development, techniques used to ensure quality of the software products and maintenance tasks performed as software evolves. By the end of the course, students will understand the role of software processes in the development of software and will have experienced several types of processes, from rigid to agile. Students will also become familiar with a variety of modern technologies and development techniques and understand their connection to software processes.

## Fall 2018

**Machine Learning For Trading**: Using machine-learning techniques to develop efficient trading strategies.

*Currently ongoing, no coursework uploaded yet*

From the OMSCS website:

>This course introduces students to the real world challenges of implementing machine learning based trading strategies including the algorithmic steps from information gathering to market orders. The focus is on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. We consider statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.

>This course is composed of three mini-courses:

>Mini-course 1: Manipulating Financial Data in Python
>Mini-course 2: Computational Investing
>Mini-course 3: Learning Algorithms for Trading
