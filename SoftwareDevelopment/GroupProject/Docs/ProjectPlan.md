## 1: Introduction

Our app, Cryptogramz4Kidz, supports the playing of cryptogram games, in which messages encoded with simple substitution cyphers are decoded. In addition, social features like the viewing of group statistics and solving of other users' puzzles are supported.

## 2: Process Description

**Create a player account**

- **Activity Description**: This activity will allow a user to create a new player account with which to create and solve cryptograms.
- **Entrance Criteria**: The user must not be logged in already, and must be on the main screen/activity of the app and select "Create Account" from the menu.
- **Exit Criteria**: Once an account is created successfully, the user must be logged into his/her new account and shown the menu of options for a player.

**Solve a cryptogram**

- **Activity Description**: this activity will allow a player to attempt to solve a given cryptogram. On completion, player and cryptogram statistics will be updated.
- **Entrance Criteria**: The player must be logged in, must be on the main menu for a player, and must select "Solve Cryptogram"
- **Exit Criteria**: Once a player completes an attempt to solve the cryptogram, the app will indicate if the cryptogram was solved successfully, and return the player to the main menu for a player. Statistics will be suitably updated.

**Create a cryptogram**

- **Activity Description**: this activity allows a logged-in player to create a new cryptogram
- **Entrance Criteria**: The player must be logged in, must be on the main menu for a player, and must select "Create Cryptogram"
- **Exit Criteria**: Once a cryptogram is successfully created, any player should be able to view, access and attempt to solve the new cryptogram.

**View cryptograms**

- **Activity Description**: This activity allows a user to view existing cryptograms in the system, be they solved, unsolved, or created, by the player.
- **Entrance Criteria**: The player must be logged in, must be on the main menu for a player, and must select "View Cryptograms"
- **Exit Criteria**: The player must be shown a menu of what types of cryptograms to view: completed, incomplete, and created. When one of those options is selected, the appropriate list of cryptograms will be shown, and individual cryptograms can be selected and solved.

**View Cryptogram Statistics**

- **Activity Description**: This activity allows a user to view the statistics for all cryptograms in the system
- **Entrance Criteria**: The player must be logged in, must be on the main menu for a player, and must select "View Cryptogram Statistics"
- **Exit Criteria**: The player is shown a list of all cryptograms in the system, complete with all relevant statistics for that cryptogram
